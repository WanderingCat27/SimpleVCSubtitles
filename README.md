# live captioning of SimpleVc mod

(unaffilated with simplevc mod and developer)

working beta of subtitles for simple vc in minecraft. Uses whisper https://github.com/openai/whisper.


This is in progress, trying to reduce the barrier to entry while maintaining speed using fast whisper versions like whisper.cpp


java whisper wrapper (https://github.com/GiviMAD/whisper-jni) (also unaffiliated) most promising but only works in dev not build (at least on macos arm) might work on windows, not investigated fully
