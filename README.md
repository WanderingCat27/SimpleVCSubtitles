# live captioning of SimpleVc mod

(Simple Voice Chat independent plugin Mod)

"working" beta (wip unreleased) of subtitles for simple vc in minecraft. Uses whisper https://github.com/openai/whisper. specifically master branch uses https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp (working but requires setup steps not currently provided)

version 1.0 should work out of the box and download the model into instance folder, no additional setup

transcription is a bit clunky rn because idk how to translate shorts to floats properly and between two different formats so whisper is not getting the best quality audio data because idk how to fix it (if you know how to work with audio help would be appreciated)

but works pretty good currently
